Quick start and environment ready.

To start you have to have installed on your computer [`laravel and composer`](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7) in order to use the commands necessary to obtain the database of the application, starting withÂ :

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

Then to start you have to enter the seeds to the database with the following command:


```sh
php artisan db: seed
```

After doing these two steps, you continue with the activation of the default Laravel development server with the following command:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Now, at this moment you need to enter with the following email generated by Laravel seeds:

E-mail: tales@que.pato   
Password: pass



And this is it, you can explore my first web development project that uses php with the Laravel framework (Do not be harsh with me, seriously it's the first of all)
It is a blog, where people are registered for example students, and various concepts such as notifications of late arrivals or absences in class and then you can generate reports of the concepts made and by the student that the girl with what was said in the concept .
